# ishous-max-import
Manages versions of max import scripts on private network

# How to run
Please check out the Wiki for detailed instructions, but generally just run the buildandbundle.bat script and install from resulting file

# Project Setup
A lot of functions will assume that the project is saved in a specific project folder, not just a .max sitting on the desktop.
Settings and mapping files will be saved locally to that project folder in its own directory.

# Ishou Local Network
The functions of this tool for importing and exporting objects is set up to run on a local private network (and the addresses are hardcoded),
but this can be adapted to work with either a different local server or through a web network.
Other functions, such as functions dealing with submaterial maps, will work because they write to local project files.
