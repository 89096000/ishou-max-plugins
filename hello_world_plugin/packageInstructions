Building 3dsmax plugin

Requirements

- 3dsmax
- .NET Framework v3.5
- 7zip (to build an installer from the source)

Building

1. Download and install 7-zip
http://www.7-zip.org/

2. Run buildandbundle.bat
(required file: bundle.bat)
This will compile the .NET code and create a .mzp installer
(basically will compile all code with dlls)

3. An mzp file will be created in the same directory of the bat file

4. Drag & drop the created file outliner.mzp into 3dsmax to start the installer
